# Quack Chess

quack chess is a homemade chess engine that aims to beat my friend who is pretty good at chess

Q- Qualified
U- Ultrafastidious
A- Academic
C- Chess
K- Kalculator

This engine once built will use minimax search with alpha-beta pruning. I would also like to try my hand at building a chess engine using some form of reinforcement learning but that is for another day
